break out the data loading stuff into some kind of object that
takes requests and fetches the data, handles failures a little bit
more cleanly - like if something fails, either try again, or notify
the user of the problem and allow them to refresh.

if a request is failing, and something is clicked, what happens?
does it launch another request?  i'm kind of lost here.

i need software that will slow down the web and simulate a bad 
mobile phone internet link.

get lists of fonts so i can start on a settings screen.

event json is based on ics format, icalendar.
uid: id@sitedomain
organizers: [{ name: ..., mail:... }]
dtstart: use standard format
dtend: use standard format
summary:
description:
locations: [{ name:, street:, city:, zip: }]
tzid: // ISO timezone id

the css and settings features don't work on android 2.1. the entire
feature should be disabled for 2.1.  it seems to cause failures unrelated
to the styling.
