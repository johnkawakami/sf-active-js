break out the data loading stuff into some kind of object that
takes requests and fetches the data, handles failures a little bit
more cleanly - like if something fails, either try again, or notify
the user of the problem and allow them to refresh.

Events should be an ICS file, but a subset of the standard, because the standard is too difficult to use, particularly the timezones.

The libraries are too huge.  all.js is 335k.  all.min.js is 186k.  main.js is 20k, which isn't too bad.  Code organization sucks.

the css and settings features don't work on android 2.1. the entire
feature should be disabled for 2.1.  it seems to cause failures unrelated
to the styling.  Use some javascript to detect, and if the user has an
old browser, send them to a page that sets a cookie, cannotusemobile, and
then onward to an html site that has responsive layouts.


Need to normalize the features to look more like the newswire stories.

Need to put a post's image into the image array.

Lists of features and articles need url of the thumbnail.

We can detect hero images.  If an image has an aspect ratio of 1:1 to 3:2, and the original is at least 900px wide, we can go hero.

16:9 can work on widescreens, but would need to be cropped for mobile phones. Crop to 3:2.

32:18 -> 27:18.  We can shave off "5" or 15.6% of the width to fit into a 3:2 rectangle.

Go through all the photos and do a histogram of popular sizes.

If the image fits, we then use an alternative layout for the title area.  The IMG tag should use srcset alternates, so narrow layouts load the smaller image and large layouts will use the full resolution.
